#  Basics
C-b

    Move back one character.
C-f

    Move forward one character.
DEL or Backspace

    Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
C-d

    Delete the character underneath the cursor.
Printing characters

    Insert the character into the line at the cursor.
C-_ or C-x C-u

    Undo the last editing command. You can undo all the way back to an empty line.

# Movement

C-a

    Move to the start of the line.
C-e

    Move to the end of the line.
M-f

    Move forward a word, where a word is composed of letters and digits.
M-b

    Move backward a word.
C-l

    Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.

# Killing

C-k

    Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.
M-d

    Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or, if between words, to the end of the next word. Word boundaries are the same as those used by M-f.
M-DEL

    Kill from the cursor to the start of the current word, or, if between words, to the start of the previous word. Word boundaries are the same as those used by M-b.
C-w

    Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace. This is different than M-DEL because the word boundaries differ.

Here is how to yank the text back into the line. Yanking means to copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.

C-y

    Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.
M-y

    Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top. You can only do this if the prior command is C-y or M-y.
